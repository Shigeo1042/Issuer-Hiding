# Verifiable encryption schemes

Verifiable encryption of discrete log(s) from the paper [Verifiable Encryption from MPC-in-the-Head](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1704.pdf).

Adapted to allow encrypting messages of a generalized Pedersen commitment and some other optimizations. See the [corresponding module](src/tz_21) for more details.
